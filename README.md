## Features and Benefits

### Paging
Through paging, a segment of data can be viewed from the assigned data source. The Blazor Tree Grid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI. It also has an on-demand paging mode for effective data retrieval from remote web services.

### Sorting
The Blazor Tree Grid allows users to sort a column by simply clicking on the header. A Ctrl + header click performs multi-sorting. Allows sorting data either in the ascending or descending order.

### Filtering
Filtering helps view specific or related records that meet a given filtering criteria. It supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter. The Blazor Tree Grid filter allows users to choose appropriate filter types, define their own custom filtering logic, and customize the filtering UI based on their application needs. Filtering with related parent or child records can be defined.

### Selection
The Blazor TreeGrid allows selecting rows or cells. One or more rows or cells can also be selected by holding Ctrl or Command, or programmatically.

### Editing
The Blazor Tree Grid provides full support to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. In addition to built-in editor components to edit a particular column value, using template support users can create custom editor components that suit their application needs. It performs editing operations with a list of business objects or remote data service with the help of the data manager.
